/**
 * @title AllowList
 * @author malteish, cjentzsch
 * @notice  The AllowList contract is used to manage a list of addresses and attest each address certain attributes.
 *   Examples for possible attributes are: is KYCed, is american, is of age, etc.
 *   One AllowList managed by one entity (e.g. tokenize.it) can manage up to 252 different attributes, and one tier with 5 levels, and can be used by an unlimited number of other Tokens.

contract AllowList is Ownable2Step {
    /**
     * @notice Stores the attributes for each address.
     * @dev Attributes are defined as bit mask, with the bit position encoding it's meaning and the bit's value whether this attribute is attested or not.
     *    Example:
     *    - position 0: 1 = has been KYCed (0 = not KYCed)
     *    - position 1: 1 = is american citizen (0 = not american citizen)
     *    - position 2: 1 = is a penguin (0 = not a penguin)
     *    These meanings are not defined within code, neither in the token contract nor the allowList. Nevertheless, the definition used by the people responsible for both contracts MUST match,
     *    or the token contract will not work as expected. E.g. if the allowList defines position 2 as "is a penguin", while the token contract uses position 2 as "is a hedgehog", then the tokens
     *    might be sold to hedgehogs, which was never the intention.
     *    Here some examples of how requirements can be used in practice:
     *    value 0b0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000101, means "is KYCed and is a penguin"
     *    value 0b0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000111, means "is KYCed, is american and is a penguin"
     *    value 0b0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000, means "has not proven any relevant attributes to the allowList operator" (default value)
     *
     *    The highest four bits are defined as tiers as follows (depicted with less bits because 256 is a lot):
     *    - 0b0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 = tier 0
     *    - 0b0001000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 = tier 1
     *    - 0b0011000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 = tier 2 (and 1)
     *    - 0b0111000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 = tier 3 (and 2 and 1)
     *    - 0b1111000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 = tier 4 (and 3 and 2 and 1)
     *    This very simple definition allows for a maximum of 5 tiers, even though 4 bits are used for encoding. By sacrificing some space it can be implemented without code changes.
