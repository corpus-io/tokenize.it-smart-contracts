/**
@title tokenize.it Token
@notice This contract implements the token used to tokenize companies, which follows the ERC20 standard and adds the following features:
    - pausing
    - access control with dedicated roles
    - burning (burner role can burn any token from any address)
    - requirements for sending and receiving tokens
    - allow list (documents which address satisfies which requirement)
    Decimals is inherited as 18 from ERC20. This should be the standard to adhere by for all deployments of this token.

    The contract inherits from ERC2771Context in order to be usable with Gas Station Network (GSN) https://docs.opengsn.org/faq/troubleshooting.html#my-contract-is-using-openzeppelin-how-do-i-add-gsn-support and meta-transactions.

    @notice  defines requirements to send or receive tokens for non-TRANSFERER_ROLE. If zero, everbody can transfer the token. If non-zero, then only those who have met the requirements can send or receive tokens. 
        Requirements can be defined by the REQUIREMENT_ROLE, and are validated against the allowList. They can include things like "must have a verified email address", "must have a verified phone number", "must have a verified identity", etc. 
        Also, tiers from 0 to four can be used.
    @dev Requirements are defined as bit mask, with the bit position encoding it's meaning and the bit's value whether this requirement will be enforced. 
        Example:
        - position 0: 1 = must be KYCed (0 = no KYC required)
        - position 1: 1 = must be american citizen (0 = american citizenship not required)
        - position 2: 1 = must be a penguin (0 = penguin status not required)
        These meanings are not defined within code, neither in the token contract nor the allowList. Nevertheless, the definition used by the people responsible for both contracts MUST match, 
        or the token contract will not work as expected. E.g. if the allowList defines position 2 as "is a penguin", while the token contract uses position 2 as "is a hedgehog", then the tokens 
        might be sold to hedgehogs, which was never the intention.
        Here some examples of how requirements can be used in practice:
        With requirements 0b0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000101, only KYCed penguins will be allowed to send or receive tokens.
        With requirements 0b0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000111, only KYCed american penguins will be allowed to send or receive tokens.
        With requirements 0b0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000, even french hedgehogs will be allowed to send or receive tokens.

        The highest four bits are defined as tiers as follows:
        - 0b0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 = tier 0 is required
        - 0b0001000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 = tier 1 is required
        - 0b0010000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 = tier 2 is required
        - 0b0100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 = tier 3 is required
        - 0b1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 = tier 4 is required
        This very simple definition allows for a maximum of 5 tiers, even though 4 bits are used for encoding. By sacrificing some space it can be implemented without code changes.

        Keep in mind that addresses with the TRANSFERER_ROLE do not need to satisfy any requirements to send or receive tokens.
